# üí´ Hi I am Calyope Ortega
## Research Data Analyst/Consultant <br> I am a trained data research consultant interested in all things Data Science! <br> 

- I am currently working on my [master's thesis](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pNDz4RPEBREXKxgsNc60CoxCZFJRfe3x62foK2muLjQ/edit?usp=sharing) analyzing how weight stigma influences perceptions of larger-bodied fitness influencers.
- I recently designed an analysis report that helped a client understand how the Local Food Purchasing Agreement (LFPA) program was utilized at various consumer levels in North Carolina. 
- I'm seeking a job in the Data Analytics field.

### Work Experience
Research Data Consultant @ Appalachian State University
- Utilized R Studio, SQL, or Excel to clean data, calculate descriptive statistics, and generate codebooks.
- Conducted numerous reliability analyses and reverse-scored items when needed to create aggregate scores and scales
- Designed dashboards, pivot tables, and figures using Power BI or Excel that facilitated a clear understanding of which trainings were the most useful in a school program.
- Developed and designed multiple Qualtrics surveys for clients and my thesis research
- Collaborated and communicated with over 20 clients using detailed research reports with visualizations and presentations to clearly define complex findings for non-technical readers.
- Ran complex multi-level models using R Studio and prepared a detailed research report that led to research efficiency for clients.

### Projects

#### Weight Stigma and Perceptions of Fitness Influencers 

- Current project: Master's Thesis

- Short [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pNDz4RPEBREXKxgsNc60CoxCZFJRfe3x62foK2muLjQ/edit?usp=sharing) on my project.

#### Weight Bias and Health Sciences Education 
<img width="979" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc10ddc3-8534-4973-a06a-5e29766d0b23">
       
- **Data Acquisition:** Health sciences educators were recruited through a cluster sampling method 
  -   Participants were emailed a Qualtrics survey 
  -   The data set was cleaned using excel 
- **Main Data Analysis:** 
  - Descriptives and Frequencies
  - Independent t-tests (_continuous scale scores and categorical variable i.e. gender_)
  - One way ANOVA (_continous scale scores and categorical variables 3 levels)

- **Skills Used:** Data cleaning using excel, data analysis using R studio, and PowerBI for visuals
    
**Data Management:** [R code](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UwdBNAFdRThNUix2GaHCW9RaYnDTMVE_6VbUVclJZAQ/edit?usp=sharing)

- The scatterplots suggest that people with low weight stereotyping and prejudice are more likely to use a Health At Every Size approach.

- The scatterplots suggest that people with higher weight stereotyping and prejudice are more likely to use a Weight Management approach.



**Conclusions:**
- Educators use a mix of HAES (_M =4.16, SD = 0.87_) and weight management (_M = 3.84, SD = 1.11 _) approaches.
- Educators with lower levels of weight prejudice and stereotypes are more likely to have use a HAES approach. 
- Educators with higher weight prejudice and stereotypes are more likely to use a weight management approach.
- The association between weight bias and use of a weight management approach was higher for weight-based stereotyping compared to prejudice.

**Future Directions**
- Utilize the information as evidence for the intervention work with health sciences students.
- Examine the effectiveness of a weight bias intervention on different health sciences students.
- Implementing a social desirability measure to assess whether that impacts bias scores.
