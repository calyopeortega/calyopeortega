### Projects
#### Weight Bias and Health Sciences Education 
- **Problems:**
  - How are health sciences educators teaching about weight in college classrooms?
  - Do the weight biases of health care educators covary with their approaches to teaching about weight and health?
- **Main Variables**
  - Weight Curriculum approaches
    -  Health At Every Size (_An approach that targets healthy habits and not weight loss_)
    -  Weight Management (_An approach that focuses on weight loss to be healthy_)
  - Weight Bias (stereotypes: thoughts; prejudice: feelings)
    -  Weight-based prejudice: Measured through the UMBFAT Scale
    -  Weight-based stereotypes: Measured through the Beliefs About Obese Persons (_BAOP_) Scale

       
- **Data Acquisition:** Health sciences educators were recruited through a cluster sampling method (_three universities in each state that have a health sciences program were randomly picked_)
  -   Educators were asked to complete a Qualtrics survey that measured weight bias, curriculum type, and demographics.
  -   The data set was cleaned using excel (_incomplete surveys were removed for consent concerns_)
- **Main Data Analysis:** 
  - Descriptives and Frequencies
  - Independent t-tests (_continuous scale scores and categorical variable i.e. gender_)
  - One way ANOVA (_continous scale scores and categorical variables 3 levels)
- **Skills Used:** Data cleaning using excel, data analysis using R studio
  -   R studio was used to make composite variables,(_combining variables into one composite score_), run alphas, and complete descriptive and inferential statistics.

**Conclusions:**
- Educators use a mix of HAES and weight management approaches.
- Educators with lower levels of weight prejudice and stereotypes are more likely to have use a HAES approach. 
- Educators with higher weight prejudice and stereotypes are more likely to use a weight management approach.
- The association between weight bias and use of a weight manage approach was higher for weight-based stereotyping compared to prejudice.

**Future Directions**
- Utilize the information as evidence for the intervention work with health sciences students.
- Examine the effectiveness of a weight bias intervention on different health sciences students.
- Implementing a social desirability measure to assess whether that impacts bias scores.
