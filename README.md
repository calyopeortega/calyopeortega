# üí´ Hi I am Calyope Ortega
## Research Data Analyst/Consultant <br> I am a trained data research consultant interested in all things Data Science! <br> 

- I am currently working on my [master's thesis](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pNDz4RPEBREXKxgsNc60CoxCZFJRfe3x62foK2muLjQ/edit?usp=sharing) analyzing how weight stigma influences perceptions of larger-bodied fitness influencers.
- I recently designed an analysis report that helped a client understand how the Local Food Purchasing Agreement (LFPA) program was utilized at various consumer levels in North Carolina. 
- I'm seeking a job in the Data Analytics field.

### Work Experience
Research Data Consultant @ Appalachian State University
- Analyzed data and built visual reports that provided support for a program that sought to increase intergenerational contact amongst adults and teens in the program. 
- Designed dashboards and pivot tables that facilitated a clear understanding of which trainings were the most useful in a program leading to funding support for continuation of the program. 
- Prepared detailed research reports and presentations that effectively communicated complex findings to clients that are unfamiliar with data analytics. 
- Conducted presentations on research findings aiding in client understanding of project outcomes. 
- Ran complex multi-level models and prepared a detailed research report that led to research efficiency for clients.
- Utilized R and Jamovi to conduct predictive analytic statistics for various clients. 
- Worked with clients to solve problems and identify trends and opportunities in their research  

### Projects

#### Weight Stigma and Perceptions of Fitness Influencers 

- Current project: Master's Thesis

- Short [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pNDz4RPEBREXKxgsNc60CoxCZFJRfe3x62foK2muLjQ/edit?usp=sharing) on my project.

#### Weight Bias and Health Sciences Education 
- **Problems:**
  - How are health sciences educators teaching about weight in college classrooms?
  - Do the weight biases of health care educators covary with their approaches to teaching about weight and health?
- **Main Variables**
  - Weight Curriculum approaches
    -  Health At Every Size (_An approach that targets healthy habits and not weight loss_)
    -  Weight Management (_An approach that focuses on weight loss to be healthy_)
  - Weight Bias (stereotypes: thoughts; prejudice: feelings)
    -  Weight-based prejudice: Measured through the UMBFAT Scale
    -  Weight-based stereotypes: Measured through the Beliefs About Obese Persons (_BAOP_) Scale

       
- **Data Acquisition:** Health sciences educators were recruited through a cluster sampling method 
  -   Participants were emailed a Qualtrics survey 
  -   The data set was cleaned using excel 
- **Main Data Analysis:** 
  - Descriptives and Frequencies
  - Independent t-tests (_continuous scale scores and categorical variable i.e. gender_)
  - One way ANOVA (_continous scale scores and categorical variables 3 levels)
- **Skills Used:** Data cleaning using excel, data analysis using R studio
  -   R studio was used to make composite variables,(_combining variables into one composite score_), run alphas, and complete descriptive and inferential statistics.
    
**Data Management:** [R code](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UwdBNAFdRThNUix2GaHCW9RaYnDTMVE_6VbUVclJZAQ/edit?usp=sharing)

- The scatterplots suggest that people with low weight stereotyping and prejudice are more likely to use a Health At Every Size approach.

- The scatterplots suggest that people with higher weight stereotyping and prejudice are more likely to use a Weight Management approach.



**Conclusions:**
- Educators use a mix of HAES and weight management approaches.
- Educators with lower levels of weight prejudice and stereotypes are more likely to have use a HAES approach. 
- Educators with higher weight prejudice and stereotypes are more likely to use a weight management approach.
- The association between weight bias and use of a weight management approach was higher for weight-based stereotyping compared to prejudice.

**Future Directions**
- Utilize the information as evidence for the intervention work with health sciences students.
- Examine the effectiveness of a weight bias intervention on different health sciences students.
- Implementing a social desirability measure to assess whether that impacts bias scores.
