### Projects
#### Weight Bias and Health Sciences Education 
- **Main Question:** Do the weight biases of health care educators covary with their approaches to teaching about weight and health?
- **Data Acquisition:** Health sciences educators were recruited through a cluster sampling method (_three universities in each state that have a health sciences program were randomly picked_)
-   Educators were asked to complete a Qualtrics survey that measured weight bias, curriculum type, and demographics.
-   The data set was cleaned using excel (_incomplete surveys were removed for consent concerns_)
-   R studio was used to make composite variables,(_combining variables into one composite score_), run alphas, and complete descriptive and inferential statistics.
-  #### R script: #Creating a composite variable in R
-      #Checking the alpha of the items in the scale to make sure there is strong reliability across items (_justification for making it a scale score_)
-          - Beliefs About Obese Persons Scale: Script for Alpha
-          - alpha(weight_ed[,c('BAOP1','BAOP2R','BAOP3','BAOP4','BAOP5','BAOP6','BAOP7R','BAOP8')])
